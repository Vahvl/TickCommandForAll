# This is a fork of BD103's mod to change the tick permission level to allow everyone to use it instead, meant for use in singleplayer worlds without cheats.


# TickLowerPerm

[![Modrinth](https://img.shields.io/badge/Modrinth-gray?logo=modrinth) ![Mod Version](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/v/4ShukODo) ![Game Version](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/game-versions/4ShukODo)](https://modrinth.com/mod/ticklowerperm)

This is a [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod that lowers the permission of the `/tick` command in Minecraft from 3 to 2, allowing command blocks to run it. This mod specifically targets snapshots [23w43a](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_23w43a) and upward. This mod has no dependencies. It is required to run server side, but is optional client side. (Clients without this mod can connect to servers with this mod.) Additionally, it is required for single player worlds.

## Snapshot Support

TickLowerPerm is only tested on the Minecraft versions specified in Modrinth and in the [release notes](https://github.com/BD103/TickLowerPerm/releases). You can run it on untested snapshot versions including and above 1.20.3, but things may break. You've been warned!
